2020-03-28 01:21:55.311173	middle right are you understanding what I'm saying what you can do is I don't really care I really don't care if you want to we can I view the stump before I change the color like it's not that hard but honestly it right
2020-03-28 01:23:19.018689	all toys
2020-03-28 01:23:23.930367	I'll tell you I'll tell you how to do that I could have done it but if you want to learn how to do I'll tell you how to do it go to Google Chrome what I use otherwise usually you'd read the CSS but person supposed to be I'll just tell you how to use Google Chrome go to web store
2020-03-28 01:23:51.479715	refined
2020-03-28 01:23:56.655741	I have eyedropper yet.
2020-03-28 01:24:08.316892	I don't go to the demo it won't work on your downloaded file for some reason or maybe try here I don't know
2020-03-28 01:24:20.971806	doesn't know how many instructions on you download can you download mine will send you it
2020-03-28 01:24:38.540690	I'll see if yours works on the downloaded
2020-03-28 01:24:47.580691	not right
2020-03-28 01:24:53.295332	but it's fine as long as you got it basically. So now you take that you see the hashtag for 9 after you copy that and then you go to canva
2020-03-28 01:25:13.707940	elements
2020-03-28 01:25:17.269598	Left Coast cool down
2020-03-28 01:25:26.237348	and then go to the color like you see on next to duplicate on the left you see that little color of this color of the Box left the other now tasting in the search bar or put it there
2020-03-28 01:25:49.043122	also do you want to make an outline of the entire thing in that as well I like or like a block you want out of black frame is there a way to do that on this cuz I can kind of help with the flow cuz right now it's like a little like I'm not sure if we search up on the web how to put a black frame or something on
2020-03-28 01:27:32.998469	are you finding it can you search it up using Pho that like a thing
2020-03-28 01:27:59.027883	no weenie like a bold one
2020-03-28 01:28:28.309715	yeah like that I think that should work
2020-03-28 01:28:39.575805	are you sure you want to make that middle line green try try with another color what do you want to make the middle I mean why actually looks pretty good I don't know I just think about it
2020-03-28 01:29:49.693309	yeah you know what I'm talking about right
2020-03-28 01:29:58.102264	don't make it a lot easier for you
2020-03-28 01:30:20.415310	I know anything let me see
2020-03-28 01:30:26.498092	play all the top and bottom dentures
2020-03-28 01:30:34.295159	Teen Spirit
2020-03-28 01:30:40.316928	or even the right side border dish up or did
2020-03-28 01:30:50.733840	I think it's a square I think it's just 1108 1108 and lowercase
2020-03-28 01:31:09.243769	yeah I think that's what it is to get rid of this middle bar everything else stays the same
2020-03-28 01:31:43.040414	yeah
2020-03-28 01:31:49.410760	commitment I don't know
2020-03-28 01:31:56.875300	which they know right cuz I don't think I'll just look at what you how you want to do in them
2020-03-28 01:32:54.468783	entirety what we've been talkin no I just kept something running like the audio to text
2020-03-28 01:33:25.002612	afraid so
2020-03-28 01:36:33.928491	before the Border do you need the middle on this one I think in this situation we could just make them blend
2020-03-28 01:37:05.970331	add a rectangle and make it a little bit no no no. You do but you know how you were out in the bar in the middle in the middle
2020-03-28 01:37:17.982182	Barbie make it transparent a little bit 50% transparent yeah
2020-03-28 01:37:28.502676	how it is odd that bar on top of it and then make it a little bit transparent I'd like a small bar just as like a transition thing
2020-03-28 01:39:03.942596	Major League
2020-03-28 01:39:07.738178	an experiment maybe like a bluish would wear a bluish pink what's in the middle of purple right let's make it purple like a light purple
2020-03-28 01:39:23.254220	no we need a little bit like more towards the blue side
2020-03-28 01:39:43.194849	this is perfect but go Lighter Side lighter lighter
2020-03-28 01:39:49.983909	I think I should work around here
2020-03-28 01:40:10.641562	I'm not even sure if it's making a difference or not but to me it seems fine
2020-03-28 01:40:20.244758	try making zero
2020-03-28 01:40:26.846379	Meijer
2020-03-28 01:40:35.639601	dude perfect just leave it at like 30 or 40
2020-03-28 01:40:43.621133	8:30

2020-03-28 01:41:10.101459	so now it's going fine over the borders not coming out right or you want beside the border the frame hold on let me see let me see let me see
2020-03-28 01:42:30.523721	are you listening going to frames and find a thicker frame sticker no because I think
2020-03-28 01:43:49.840493	Call of Duty II
2020-03-28 01:44:24.768632	know the top and bottom are definitely showing right it's just a sides yet as bring the frames in a little bit.
2020-03-28 01:44:38.022003	no don't do that much do very minimally or you can't know you wanted to walk in that way it's even on each side
2020-03-28 01:46:00.093645	go back
2020-03-28 01:46:02.968339	that is really really weird
2020-03-28 01:46:15.236343	it should be slightly taller than it is wider dude if you found the dimensions of that picture could be crazy easy
2020-03-28 01:46:31.310011	you have time at the end fix it but I think just go to sleep
2020-03-28 01:48:50.959449	give me one second

2020-03-28 01:49:39.305834	or again why are you even doing this remove the frame
2020-03-28 01:49:50.091211	and drag over both images
2020-03-28 01:49:58.948341	no go outside drag click and drag you drag over both of them what are you doing go outside click click and hold click and hold and quick right there and hold
2020-03-28 01:50:22.152006	images I need you to make them both you keep making it smaller
2020-03-28 01:50:40.017942	now put in the middle

2020-03-28 01:52:57.220894	but you can pick the place
2020-03-28 01:53:03.497274	select this click on the side
2020-03-28 01:53:12.978089	quick on the side
